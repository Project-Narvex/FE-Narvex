# CSP Nonce Implementation Fix

## Problem
The application was showing Content Security Policy (CSP) errors:
```
Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'self'". Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-...'), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution.
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Dynamic Rendering in layout.tsx
- Added `import { headers, connection } from 'next/server'`
- Made RootLayout an async function
- Added `await connection()` to force dynamic rendering
- Retrieved nonce from headers and added to body element

### 2. Middleware Configuration (middleware.ts)
- Already properly configured with CSP headers
- Generates unique nonce for each request
- Sets proper CSP directives

### 3. Production Build & Docker
- Successfully built and tested production build
- Docker container runs on port 3200
- No CSP errors in production environment

## Verification
- ✅ Development server: No CSP errors
- ✅ Production build: No CSP errors  
- ✅ Docker container: No CSP errors
- ✅ Application accessible globally on port 3200

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm start

# Docker
docker-compose up --build -d
```

## Access URLs
- Development: http://localhost:3200
- Production: http://localhost:3000
- Docker: http://localhost:3200

The application is now ready for global deployment without CSP errors.
